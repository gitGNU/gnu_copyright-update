NAME
    copyright-update - Update Copyright information in files

SYNOPSIS
      copyright-update [options] FILE [FILE ...]
      copyright-update [options] --recursive PATH [PATH ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Update the copyright information in set of files, possibly recursively,
    matching content criteria. The updating affects copyright year, GPL
    address information etc.

    The line must have word "Copyright", a space, three characters '(C)' (or
    a U+00A9 UTF copyright sign), a space, and the range of years. Varying
    amount of spaces and tabs are permitted, but there must be no spaces
    around the dash-character in YEAR-YEAR. Examples:

                A whitespace, or multiple, required
                |   |           No space between years
                |   |           |
       Copyright (C)        YYYY-YYYY
       Copyright: (C)       YYYY-YYYY
                |
                A colon is optional

    By default certain files and paths are always ignored; like version
    control directories, backups files, object files and binary files
    according to Perl's "-T" file test. Run program with option
    --help-exclude to see exclude path list.

OPTIONS
  Run options
    -a, --auto
        In automatic mode, the author's name is read from environment
        variable NAME and only lines matching 'Copyright.*$NAME' are
        affected. If NAME is not set, read information from EMAIL. See
        section ENVIRONMENT.

        This option effectively presets value for the --line option.

    -c, --code
        Preset --include to match common code files: .c, .h, .cc, .hh, .cpp,
        .c++, .hpp, .C, .pl, .py, .sh and .rb

    -d, --debug LEVEL
        Turn on debug. Level can be in range 0-10.

    -f, --fsf-address
        Change FSF address paragraphs to point to URL, according to latest
        FSF recommendation:

            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
            along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

        Affects: paragraph with old address:

            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
            along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
            Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

        Affects: paragraph with new address:

            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
            along with this package; if not, write to the Free Software
            Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301USA

    -i, --include REGEXP
        Include files matching regexp. The match is done against whole path.

        If this option is not supplied, every file is automatically
        included. The matches can be further filtered by using option
        --exclude.

        This option can be used multiple times. See also option --code.

    -l, --line REGEXP
        Change only lines which match REGEXP. The match is case-insensitive.

    -r, --recursive
        Recursively search all direcotories given in command line.

    -R, --regexp REGEXP
        Change only files whose content matches REGEXP. The file is read in
        as a one big string so it's possible to match using Perl regular
        expressions across lines. An example:
        '(?smi)This.*multi.*line.*match'. See perlre(1) for more information
        about 'smi' modifiers.

        This option can be used as a preliminary *Content criteria*, to
        select the file, before --line option finds the correct Copyright
        line.

    -t, --test, --dry-run
        Run in test mode. Show what would happen. No files are changed.

    -v, --verbose LEVEL
        Print informational messages. Increase numeric LEVEL for more
        verbosity.

    -x, --exclude REGEXP
        Ignore files matching regexp. The match is done against whole path.
        The option can be used multiple times.

        This option is applied after possible --include matches.

    -y, --year YEAR
        Update files using YEAR. Value must be four digits.

        The default operaton is to use currect year, so this option is not
        necessary in normal use. Use case: you plan to take a long holiday
        before year's end and want to update the next year's value
        beforehand.

    -Y, --no-year
        Disable updating year.

  Miscellaneus options
    -h, --help
        Display help.

    --help-exclude
        Display default values in the program that whow what values are used
        to exclude paths and files.

    --help-html
        Display help in HTML format.

    --help-man
        Display help in manual page man(1) format.

    -V, --version
        Display contact and version information.

EXAMPLES
    The primary use is to update files to reflect current year; option
    --year is implicit:

       copyright-update *

    To test what would happen:

       copyright-update --verbose 1 --test *

    Update only C-code file:

       copyright-update --verbose 1 --include '\.[ch]$' --recursive .

    It is possible to restrict updating files recursively to only those
    files whose content match regexp. Here, the lines affected are those
    that match --line regular expression.

       copyright-update \
            --regexp  '(?i)Author:.*John.*Doe' \
            --line    '\bFoo\b' \
            --ignore  '\.(bak|bup|[~#]])$' \
            --verbose 1 \
            --year    2002 \
            --test \
            --recursive \
            .

TROUBLESHOOTING
    See option --debug.

ENVIRONMENT
    EMAIL
        In the form "firstname.lastname@example.com"; that is, without the
        angles <>. If set, the value is used in option --auto only if
        environment variable NAME is not set. In order to find first and
        lastname, the localpart in email address must match case insensitive
        regexp '^[a-z-]+\.[a-z-]+@' or it is not used:

            address@example.com            Not used
            mr.first.lastname@example.com  Not used
            +---------------- +----------
            |                 |
            Localpart         Domain part

    NAME
        In the form "Firstname Lastname". If set, the value is used in
        option --auto.

FILES
    None.

EXIT STATUS
    Not defined.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    The Copyright stanzas searched with option --fsf-address must be exactly
    like in the FSF recommendation in order for them to be noticed.
