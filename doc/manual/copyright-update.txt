NAME
    copyright-update - Update Copyright information in files

SYNOPSIS
      copyright-update [options] FILE [FILE ...] | --recursive PATH [PATH ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Update the copyright information in set of files, possibly recursively,
    matching content criteria. The updating affects copyright year, GPL
    address information etc.

    The line must have word "Copyright", a space, three characters '(C)' (or
    a U+00A9 UTF copyright sign), a space, and the range of years. Varying
    amount of spaces and tabs are permitted, but there must be no spaces
    around the dash-character in YEAR-YEAR. Examples:

                A whitespace, or multiple, required
                |   |           No space between years
                |   |           |
       Copyright (C)        YYYY-YYYY
       Copyright: (C)       YYYY-YYYY
                |
                A colon is optional

    By default certan files and paths are always ignored; like version
    control directories, backups files, object files and binary files
    according to Perl's "-T" file test. See option --help-exclude.

OPTIONS
    -a, --auto
        In automatic mode, the author's name is read from environment
        variable NAME and only lines matching 'Copyright.*$NAME' are
        affected. If NAME is not set, read information from EMAIL. See
        section ENVIRONMENT.

        This option effectively presets value for the --line option.

    -d, --debug LEVEL
        Turn on debug. Level can be in range 0-10.

    --fsf-address
        Change FSF (a)ddress paragraphs pointing only to URL. This format is
        the format used in the GPL v3 license text:

    -h, --help
        Print text help

    --help-exclude
        Print default values that exclude paths and files.

    --help-html
        Print help in HTML format.

    --help-man
        Print help in manual page man(1) format.

    -i, --include REGEXP
        Include files mathing regexp. The match is done against whole path.
        The option can be used multiple times.

        If this option is not supplied, every file is automatically
        included. The matches can be further filtered by using options
        --exclude.

    -l, --line REGEXP
        Change only lines which match REGEXP. The match is case-insensitive.

    -r, --recursive
        Recursively search all direcotories given at command line.

    -R, --regexp REGEXP
        Change only files whose content matches REGEXP. The file is read in
        as a one big string so it's possible to match using Perl regular
        epxressions accross lines. An example:
        '(?smi)This.*multi.*line.*match'. See perlre(1) for more information
        about 'smi' modifiers.

        This options can be used as a preliminary *Content criteria*, to
        select the file, before --line option finds the correct Copyright
        line.

    -t, --test, --dry-run
        Run in test mode. Show what would happen. No files are changed.

    -v, --verbose LEVEL
        Print informational messages. Increase numeric LEVEL for more
        verbosity.

    -V, --version
        Print contact and version information.

    -x, --exclude REGEXP
        Ignore files mathing regexp. The match is done against whole path.
        The option can be used multiple times.

        This option is applied after possible --include matches.

    -y, --year YEAR
        Update files using YEAR. Value must be four digits. Without this
        option, program uses current calendar year.

    -Y, --no-year
        Disable updating year.

EXAMPLES
    The primary use is to update files to reflect current year:

       copyright-update --verbose 1 [--test] *

    Update only C-code file:

       copyright-update --verbose 1 --include "*.[ch]" --recursive .

    It is possible to restrict updating files recursively to only those
    files whose content match regexp, like author is "Mr. Foo". The lines
    affected are those that match --line regular expression.

       copyright-update \
            --recursive \
            --regexp "Author:.*Mr. Foo" \
            --line '\bFoo\b' \
            --ignore '\.(bak|bup|[~#]])$' \
            --verbose 1 \
            --year 2002 \
            --test \
            .

        localpart in email address must match case insensitive regexp
        '^[a-z-]+\.[a-z-]+@' or it is not used:

            address@example.com         Not used
